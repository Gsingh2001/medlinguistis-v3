# Medlinguitis 🧠✨

**Medlinguitis** is an AI-driven platform that transforms unstructured patient narratives into structured, clinically actionable Quality of Life (QoL) insights for **Abdominal Wall Hernia (AWH)** patients. Built using **Next.js**, **Material UI**, and **Firebase**, it empowers clinicians and researchers with thematic analysis, mental health signals, emotion detection, and automated PDF reporting.

---

## 🩺 Problem Statement

Abdominal Wall Hernia is a complex condition that impacts not only physical health but also **mental well-being, body image, social relationships**, and **employment**. Existing QoL tools often fail to capture these themes in depth, and manual analysis is slow, inconsistent, and unscalable.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

Medlinguitis uses **NLP models**, **emotion recognition**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to extract core themes from narratives, identify mental health markers, and generate detailed summaries for doctors and patients.

---

## 🔍 Core Features

- **Thematic Classification** (PubMedBERT-based)  
  Classifies text into five QoL domains: Symptoms/Function, Body Image, Mental Health, Interpersonal Relationships, Employment/Finance

- **Sentiment & Emotion Analysis**  
  Detects polarity (positive/neutral/negative) and emotion scores (sadness, optimism, anger, etc.)

- **Mental Health Signal Detection**  
  Flags risk markers like anxiety, hopelessness, frustration, and social withdrawal

- **Smart Excerpt Finder (RAG)**  
  Uses both keyword and semantic search to find supporting quotes

- **AI-Generated PDF Reports**  
  Downloadable and clinician-friendly summaries of the patient’s QoL profile

- **Interactive AI Chatbot**  
  Explore patient data through natural language queries

- **Role-Based Access**  
  Separate views and features for **patients** and **doctors**

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js + Material UI
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database**: Firebase Realtime Database
- **NLP Models**: PubMedBERT, Emotion Detection, Zero-Shot Classification
- **PDF Generation**: PDFKit / html-pdf
