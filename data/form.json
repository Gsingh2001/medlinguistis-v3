      "Symptoms_Restrictions_Activities": "It can do but I get by wearing an abdominal binder. It allows me to get on with life. I have bled but have finally found something I love. [cite_start]I run dancing classes too. [cite: 231, 232, 233]",
      "Symptoms_Adaptations_Face": "Yes, as above, I use an abdominal binder/corset. [cite_start]It helps me a lot but is difficult to wear in hot weather. [cite: 234]",

      "BodyImage_Others_Noticing": "Oh definitely they do. If I don't have my corset and someone comes home late, women in my village I can see they are quite shocked & want to comment but are trying to be polite. It leads to awkward silences.

[cite: 244, 245]",
      "MentalHealth_Affected_Elaborate": "Yes it has. I used to be incredibly fit. Over time this has reduced and I feel terrible about it.

      "MentalHealth_Coping_Strategies": "Not being able to act on feeling, I was forced to give up being a dance teacher. I read more to face the statistics. [cite_start]I think I'm better adjusted to the situation and that is just how it is. [cite: 251, 252]",
      "Relationships_Social_Affected": "I try not to let it affect my social life. As I said, I find using a corset very helpful. I put it on & go out for activities. [cite_start]Social activities help me cope with the hernia so I have to get myself out there and do what it takes. [cite: 255, 256, 257]",
      "Relationships_Intimate_Affected": "I have a supportive partner. [cite_start]Our relationship is one of companionship rather than intimacy. [cite: 258, 259]",
